### Quick description of the project
We are provided with preoperative and postoperative images of computed-tomotraphy of the cochlea before and after implantation of electrodes. The goal of this project is to detect the center of the cochlea as well as the electrodes and, for each electrodes, compute the angular insertion depth. 


Content of this repository:

* **Graphics**: Contains different pictures used as pattern or test for the programm. They are not directly used by the program. 

* **Papers**: Contains different publication of interest

* **Project**: Contain the Python project, including the virtual environment, the data, the patterns (images for pattern matching) and of course the results (csv outputs and GEN_IMG for generated images).

   **Note:** the file **config.py** is configured so that the program gives a minimum output. You can change this and many other parameters in there.
   To run the programm, run **main.py**. It will produce an output (console + csv) of the data. The original data should be stored in the */DATA/* folder.

* **Handout**: Contains the instructions and teams composition.

* Report in pdf format

* Results Excel sheet
